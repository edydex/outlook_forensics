Would be nice to add another tab to HTML output - Digested Information, which would make the data even more readable. 

For "HardDelete", since some entries have more than one "AffectedItems", have it be a "tree" with 2 offsets, 
"CreationDate" being the title for "the parent", "AffectedItems" "Path" being the sub-parent, 
and "Subject" property being the title for each "AffectedItems".
See first data set for example.

Make it easy to extract every single "Id" (under "AffectedItems") - by just clicking "Export IDs" button

"MoveToDeletedItems", "Send", "SoftDelete", and Update should be basically the same (see dataset 2, 3, and 4)
 
For "ItemsAccessed" its mostly the same, there will need to be 2 offsets in a the tree - Parent being the 
"CreationDate", subparent being "Folders" "Path" (ex. "\\Inbox" or "\\Sent Items"), and the branches being the last 
section of each "Id" of "FolderItems" (ex. ".../yi18AAqrged5AAAJ") - See the 5th sample data set. 

Similar to "HardDelete", I want all IDs to be easy to export, at one click of a button (IDs in the export need to be 
full length though).

For "New-InboxRule", again, have it be a tree with 2 offsets - parent being the "CreationDate", sub-parent being the 
"Name" "Parameters", and then with the last branches being the rest of the parameters, from top to bottom. (see dataset 6).

On "IP Breakdown" tab, at the top, add a pie-chart where the pie represents all traffic, and slices represent each IP, and
clicking on each slice would send you to an "anchor" (#).

Also, add a little "(i)" next to each Operation Title in "Digest Data" tabs that explain what that Operation means, and
common things to look for.

There is also a bug where "Digested Information" and "Timeline" events, when hovered over, have a set position where the
small pop-up will "pop up", which will often be off-screen. Need to fix it to make it appear near the mouse pointer.
